# OAuth2 Proxy Server

OAuth2 Proxy Server secures applications with OAuth2 authentication and offers an advantage through its local login support. This proxy server acts as an intermediary between your application and an OAuth2 provider, streamlining the authentication process and enhancing security. Built on the Spring Boot framework, it seamlessly integrates local login capabilities, making it an excellent choice for projects that require both OAuth2 and traditional authentication methods.
